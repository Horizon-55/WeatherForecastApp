# WeatherForecastApp
This is a WeatherForecastApp in C# Api from OpenWeatherForecast for a collage.
I learned how to make this project from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALV7hWJ_Vnw Thanks to this person who taught me how to make a good design by his example, 
I also recommend his YouTube channel, but I also made my part of this project, so 
let's say there will be a bug with the addition of the city. And so I needed it for practice, namely for college.
